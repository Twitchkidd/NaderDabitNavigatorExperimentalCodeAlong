#Nader Dabit's late 2016 NavigatorExperimental article, a code-along

Note to self:
```javascript
const {
  CardStack: NavigationCardStack
} = NavigationExperimental;
```
is equivalent to
```javascript
const NavigationCardStack = NavigationExperimental.CardStack;
```
... I think. At least the app loads the same either way. Should probably take an ES6 course next.
